The **Panic of 1819** was the first major economic crisis of the United States. It was caused by:
- Bad banking practices by[[State-chartered banks (1811) | private banks]] and the inability of the Second Bank of the United States to properly regulate them
- Farmers and planters faced an abrupt drop in agricultural prices, leading them to not be able to pay back debts owed to banks
