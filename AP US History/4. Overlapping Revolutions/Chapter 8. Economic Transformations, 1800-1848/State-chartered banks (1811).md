After the charter for the First Bank of the United States expired, the Jeffersonian Republican-dominated Congress refused to renew it. Instead, **state-chartered banks** were created with thousands of individual stockholders and banknotes in circulation. These state banks were often shady operations that:
- issued notes without adequate specie reserves
- made loans to insiders
- lent generously to land speculators
