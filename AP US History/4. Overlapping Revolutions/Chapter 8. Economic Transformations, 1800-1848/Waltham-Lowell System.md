Pioneered by Francis Cabot Lowell, the **Waltham-Lowell System** tapped into a cheaper source of labour: young farm girls. Factories recruited these women effectively due to:

- more independence for women and gave them a sense of freedom
- living conditions were better than in farmhouses
- social events at the factories
