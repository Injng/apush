In British North America, **slavery** existed mostly in the Southern colonies who relied heavily on plantation agriculture as their economic system. 

### Decline of Slavery
In the North, slavery was slowly phased out through **gradual emancipation**, laws that set precedence which freed slaves. However, many freed African Americans still faced severe prejudice and "second-class citizenship".

In the era of the American Revolution, slavery was in sharp decline. Many citizens perceived a contradiction between the values in the Declaration of Independence and the institution of slavery.

Slave-owners in the South relied on two fundamental arguments:
- *necessary evil* argument, claiming that while slavery is inherently an evil, it was necessary because there was no better alternative
- *positive good* argument, claiming that slaves were genetically inferior and slavery was benevolent to them as it provided "tutelage" and subsidized an elegant lifestyle for the white elite

### The Cotton Boom and Slavery
As the [[Cotton boom]] was triggered, the need for slaves in the South also dramatically rose, ending the decline of slavery in the era preceding it.

At first, planters imported new African slaves, however as this was banned, the **domestic slave trade** took shape. Domestic slave traders used two methods:
- **coastal trade**, where coastal trading routes sent thousands of slaves to rapidly developing plantations
- **inland trade**, where traders hopped from village to village buying young slaves and then sold them further west
The domestic slave trade was crucial to the prosperity of the fast-developing "Cotton South".
