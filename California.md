## Statehood
- The [[California Gold Rush]] led California's population to rise, enough for it to apply to be a state
- Bid for admission led to conflict over slavery and four distinct responses:
	1. Calhoun proposed to split the executive power with two presidents, one North and one South
		- gained support in the Deep South
	2. Extend the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific Ocean
		- won the backing of several influential Northern senators
	3. Use [[Popular sovereignty]] to decide the issue of slavery
		- some supported it, believing it will relieve the tension in Congress by placing it in the hands of states
	4. Restrict slavery within its original borders
		- [[Free soilers]] proposed this, did not accept the expansion of slavery
- Led to the [[Compromise of 1850]] [1]
