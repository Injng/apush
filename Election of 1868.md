- after [[Andrew Johnson]]'s replacing of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton with [[Ulysses S. Grant]], Grant voluntarily stepped down so Stanton could resume

	- Grant, however, publicly opposed Johnson's policies
	- his resignation made him a Republican idol
- combined with the backing of the Republicans and a war hero, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] easily won the election of 1868 [1]
