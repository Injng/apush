## End of the War
- at war's end, President Polk, Secretary of State Buchanan, and several senators wanted to annex Mexican territory
	- most argued that this would require assimilation of Mexicans
	- only favored annexation of sparsely populated regions
- signed [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]

## Aftermath
- [[Mexican Cession]] from the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]
- creation of the Oregon Territory in 1848 led to exploitative treaties with Native Americans
- sectional conflict increased over how to handle slavery in the newly acquired lands
- new movement of [[Free soilers]]
- rejection of the [[Wilmot Proviso]] led to beliefs of a [["Slave power" conspiracy]]
- many joined the [[Free soilers]] [1]
