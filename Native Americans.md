## Civil War
- during the [[Civil War]], US military attention shifted away from Native Americans
- frontier whites felt vulnerable and decided to take things into their own hands
- [[Cheyenne]] tribe felt they were going to be attacked, so chief Black Kettle decided to consult with U.S. agents
	- told them to settle along Sand Creek until a treaty could be made
- [[Colorado]] militia attacked nevertheless in the [[Sand Creek Massacre]]
	- [[Sioux]] and [[Cheyenne]] retaliated under the [[Fetterman Massacre]]
- violence led to the [[Native American peace policy]] of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] [1]
